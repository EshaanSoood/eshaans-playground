Welcome to Eshaan's Playground\
\
Hey, my name is Eshaan Sood. I\'92m a musician who also happens to be blind. in February 2025 I a few months before I was about to graduate from college, I asked a friend to help me build a website. I was a design student before I went blind and in a parallel universe, I would have just built my website myself. I had some very kind friends who didn\'92t charge me their normal rate and helped me out. However as time went on my ideas of what I wanted grew more and more.  \
\
I also wanted to build accessible web experiences for my music projects. With a dep love of systems design and user experience and absolutely no coding knowledge what so ever, I decided to dip my toes into the dreaded pool of using AI to code. Through the three projects I have made so far, I went from asking someone to build me a basic website to building and shipping an interactive Next JS app. \
\
This blog outlines my journey of jumping back into the design world with accessibility first principles. So whether you are a developer, a fellow nerd or just someone curious I hope you find some interesting things along this story.   \

February 2nd 2025 - Asking A Friend To Build My Website.\
\
Like a lot of things with being blind, I had to ask for help for something I did not know how to do - make a website.\
\
	I was about to graduate from college. I tried countless website building tools like Squarespace, wix, Webflow but none of them were accessible for blind people. After trying quite a bit, and having owned {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://eshaansood.in"}}{\fldrslt \ul eshaansood.in}} for 4 months, I finally called my friend AAdhithya Kota. Kota is a Webflow expert. Kind of a wizard with building webpages even back in 2014 when I was still in the Srishti School of Art with him, he was my first pick to build this page out.  I was about to release and album and I had to raise some money for it without going the usual Kickstarter Route. So he built out a whole page where people could see the ins and outs of what goes into making an album and a form they could use to donate. \
\
While seemingly simple, we had to think of UX even then since getting people from understanding whats up to giving me money had to be an easy step. \
\
The crowdfunding was a success and we were able to fund the album fully. This album is called Dream River and this album was about to change my life. You\'92ll see why.\
\
After the crowdfunding had closed, we transitioned from the crowd funded crowdfunding website to what you see now  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.eshaansood.in"}}{\fldrslt \ul www.eshaansood.in}} A clean static website that used to be hosted on Webflow. Kota however had started a new job and was busy and me calling him all the time to make changes to the website was getting annoying for everyone involved. \
\
Remember how I told you Dream River was about to change my life forever? Well the first thing I ever vibe coded was a page for the tour we were going on for the album. I got Chat GPT to code a single page. Since Kota was busy I thought I\'92d do him a solid by coding this page and he could just really quickly mimic it in Webflow. \
\
If you want to see what I vibe coded you can click here. Or check out the screenshot blow. \
\
The problem was that ChatGPT totally missed the mark with the fact that webflow at the time didn\'92t have a CMS where you could just host whatever you wanted. We wanted to host Ical files that people could click on and create events on their phone.\
\
So he ended up making this page instead - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.eshaansood.in/tour"}}{\fldrslt \ul www.eshaansood.in/tour}} screenshots below if you want to check it out.\
\
The thing was though, I now had  a taste for using AI to code something the way I wanted it. And I was willing to go down the road a little bit to see where that path would take me.\
\
In the next post, see how I went from a simple tour page to creating a digital web experience.  kicks \
