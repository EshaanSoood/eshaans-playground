Welcome to Eshaan's Playground

Hi, I'm Eshaan. This blog showcases my non-music dev projects and the process behind them. It's a narrative journey from asking a friend to build my site to shipping my own Next.js projects in ~9 months.

I write about accessibility, thoughtful UX, and the technical decisions that shape the projects I build. Whether you're a developer, hiring manager, or someone interested in accessible web experiences, I hope you find something valuable here.

First Steps: Asking a Friend to Build My Site

The beginning of my web development journey, starting with asking a friend for help.

It all started with a simple request: "Can you help me build a website?" I had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I wanted something online that represented me and my work.

The Request

I reached out to a friend who was already working as a web developer. At the time, I thought building a website was something you just... did. I didn't realize the complexity, the decisions, the trade-offs involved.

Looking back, I'm grateful for that initial help. It opened my eyes to what was possible, but it also made me realize I wanted to understand how it all worked.

The Realization

After seeing the site come together, I started asking questions:

- How does this work?
- Why did you choose this approach?
- Can I change this myself?

Those questions led me down a path I never expected to take. Within a few months, I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own.

What I Learned

The most important lesson from this experience wasn't technical—it was about curiosity. Once I started asking "how" and "why," I couldn't stop. That curiosity is what drives me today.

Next Steps

This was just the beginning. In the next post, I'll share how I went from asking for help to building my first project independently.

Learning HTML and CSS: The Foundation

My journey learning the fundamentals of web development, starting with HTML and CSS.

After seeing my friend build my first site, I was hooked. I needed to understand how it all worked. So I started with the basics: HTML and CSS.

Starting from Scratch

I began with free online resources—tutorials, documentation, and lots of experimentation. The first time I wrote HTML and saw it render in a browser, I was amazed. It felt like magic.

The Struggles

Learning wasn't always smooth:

1. Semantic HTML: Understanding when to use <div> vs <section> vs <article>
2. CSS Layout: Flexbox and Grid seemed impossible at first
3. Responsive Design: Making things work on mobile felt like solving a puzzle

But each struggle taught me something valuable.

Breakthrough Moments

There were moments when things clicked:

- Understanding the box model
- Getting Flexbox to work for the first time
- Creating a responsive layout that actually worked

These small wins kept me going.

Code Example

Here's a simple example of what I was learning:

Moving Forward

HTML and CSS gave me the foundation I needed. Next, I wanted to make things interactive. That's when JavaScript entered the picture.

Building My Portfolio Site: A Real Project

Taking everything I learned and applying it to build my own portfolio website from scratch.

After months of learning, I was ready to build something real. I decided to rebuild my portfolio site from scratch, using everything I'd learned so far.

The Decision

I chose to use Next.js for this project. It felt like the right balance of structure and flexibility. Plus, I wanted to learn React, and Next.js seemed like a great way to do that.

Planning the Project

Before writing any code, I spent time planning:

- What pages do I need?
- How should the navigation work?
- What's the content structure?

This planning phase saved me a lot of time later.

Building the Foundation

I started with the basics:

1. Setting up the Next.js project
2. Creating the layout structure
3. Building reusable components

Each step built on the previous one.

Challenges and Solutions

Challenge: Responsive Navigation

Creating a mobile-friendly navigation menu was trickier than I expected. I ended up using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox to make it work.

Challenge: Performance

I wanted the site to be fast. This led me to learn about:
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
- Static generation

The Result

After weeks of work, I had a portfolio site I was proud of. More importantly, I had learned so much in the process.

Key Takeaways

1. Planning matters: Time spent planning saves time coding
2. Start simple: Build the basics first, then add complexity
3. Learn by doing: Building real projects teaches you more than tutorials

This project was a turning point. It showed me I could build something real, something I could be proud of.

Accessibility First: Building Inclusive Web Experiences

Discovering the importance of accessibility and making it a core part of my development process.

As I continued building projects, I started learning about accessibility. It changed how I think about web development completely.

The Wake-Up Call

I was building a form when someone asked me: "Can someone using a screen reader fill this out?" I had no idea. That question sent me down a rabbit hole that changed everything.

Learning the Basics

I started with the fundamentals:

- Semantic HTML: Using the right elements for the right purpose
- ARIA attributes: When and how to use them
- Keyboard navigation: Ensuring everything works without a mouse
- Color contrast: Making sure text is readable

Real-World Impact

Learning about accessibility made me realize:

The web should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.

This isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential.

Practical Examples

Semantic HTML

ARIA Labels

Keyboard Navigation

Tools and Resources

I discovered amazing tools:

- axe DevTools: Browser extension for accessibility testing
- WAVE: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- Screen readers: Testing with NVDA and VoiceOver

Making It a Habit

Now, accessibility is part of my process from the start:

1. Use semantic HTML
2. Test with keyboard navigation
3. Check color contrast
4. Test with screen readers

The Impact

Building accessible sites isn't just the right thing to do—it makes sites better for everyone. Better structure, clearer navigation, more robust code.

This focus on accessibility has become central to how I work, and it's something I'm passionate about sharing with others.

Next.js Deep Dive: Understanding the Framework

Going deeper into Next.js, exploring static generation, server components, and more advanced features.

After building my portfolio with Next.js, I wanted to understand the framework better. What makes it special? How does it work under the hood?

Static Generation vs Server-Side Rendering

One of the first things I learned was the difference between static generation and server-side rendering:

- Static Generation: Pages are built at build time
- Server-Side Rendering: Pages are generated on each request

For my blog, static generation made perfect sense. All the content is known at build time, so why generate it on every request?

The App Router

Next.js 13+ introduced the App Router, which changed how I structure my projects:

This file-based routing is intuitive and powerful.

Server Components

Server Components were a game-changer. Being able to fetch data directly in components without client-side JavaScript was revolutionary:

Image Optimization

Next.js Image component handles optimization automatically:

This was a huge performance win.

Metadata API

The new Metadata API makes SEO much easier:

What I Learned

1. Static generation is powerful: For content sites, it's often the best choice
2. File-based routing is intuitive: It makes project structure clear
3. Performance matters: Next.js optimizations make a real difference

Moving Forward

Understanding Next.js deeply has made me a better developer. I can make informed decisions about when to use static generation, when to use SSR, and how to structure my projects for maximum performance and developer experience.

This framework has become my go-to for building web applications, and I'm excited to continue exploring its capabilities.
