# February 2nd 2025 - Asking A Friend To Build My Website.

Like a lot of things with being blind, I had to ask for help for something I did not know how to do - make a website.

I was about to graduate from college. I tried countless website building tools like Squarespace, wix, Webflow but none of them were accessible for blind people. After trying quite a bit, and having owned eshaansood.in for 4 months, I finally called my friend AAdhithya Kota. Kota is a Webflow expert. Kind of a wizard with building webpages even back in 2014 when I was still in the Srishti School of Art with him, he was my first pick to build this page out. I was about to release and album and I had to raise some money for it without going the usual Kickstarter Route. So he built out a whole page where people could see the ins and outs of what goes into making an album and a form they could use to donate.

While seemingly simple, we had to think of UX even then since getting people from understanding whats up to giving me money had to be an easy step.

The crowdfunding was a success and we were able to fund the album fully. This album is called Dream River and this album was about to change my life. You'll see why.

After the crowdfunding had closed, we transitioned from the crowd funded crowdfunding website to what you see now at www.eshaansood.in A clean static website that used to be hosted on Webflow. Kota however had started a new job and was busy and me calling him all the time to make changes to the website was getting annoying for everyone involved.

Remember how I told you Dream River was about to change my life forever? Well the first thing I ever vibe coded was a page for the tour we were going on for the album. I got Chat GPT to code a single page. Since Kota was busy I thought I'd do him a solid by coding this page and he could just really quickly mimic it in Webflow.

The problem was that ChatGPT totally missed the mark with the fact that webflow at the time didn't have a CMS where you could just host whatever you wanted. We wanted to host Ical files that people could click on and create events on their phone.

So he ended up making this page instead - www.eshaansood.in/tour screenshots below if you want to check it out.

The thing was though, I now had a taste for using AI to code something the way I wanted it. And I was willing to go down the road a little bit to see where that path would take me.

In the next post, see how I went from a simple tour page to creating a digital web experience. kicks
