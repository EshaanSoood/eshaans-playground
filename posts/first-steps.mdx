# First Steps: Asking a Friend to Build My Site

It all started with a simple request: "Can you help me build a website?" I had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I wanted something online that represented me and my work.

## The Request

I reached out to a friend who was already working as a web developer. At the time, I thought building a website was something you just... did. I didn't realize the complexity, the decisions, the trade-offs involved.

Looking back, I'm grateful for that initial help. It opened my eyes to what was possible, but it also made me realize I wanted to understand how it all worked.

## The Realization

After seeing the site come together, I started asking questions:

- How does this work?
- Why did you choose this approach?
- Can I change this myself?

Those questions led me down a path I never expected to take. Within a few months, I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own.

## What I Learned

The most important lesson from this experience wasn't technical—it was about curiosity. Once I started asking "how" and "why," I couldn't stop. That curiosity is what drives me today.

```javascript
// This is where it all started
const curiosity = "What if I could build this myself?";
const result = learnWebDevelopment();
```

## Next Steps

This was just the beginning. In the next post, I'll share how I went from asking for help to building my first project independently.
