# Accessibility First: Building Inclusive Web Experiences

As I continued building projects, I started learning about accessibility. It changed how I think about web development completely.

## The Wake-Up Call

I was building a form when someone asked me: "Can someone using a screen reader fill this out?" I had no idea. That question sent me down a rabbit hole that changed everything.

## Learning the Basics

I started with the fundamentals:

- **Semantic HTML**: Using the right elements for the right purpose
- **ARIA attributes**: When and how to use them
- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensuring everything works without a mouse
- **Color contrast**: Making sure text is readable

## Real-World Impact

Learning about accessibility made me realize:

> The web should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.

This isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential.

## Practical Examples

### Semantic HTML

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- Good -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### ARIA Labels

```html
<button aria-label="Close navigation menu">
  <svg>...</svg>
</button>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

```css
/* Ensure focus is visible */
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Tools and Resources

I discovered amazing tools:

- **axe DevTools**: Browser extension for accessibility testing
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Screen readers**: Testing with NVDA and VoiceOver

## Making It a Habit

Now, accessibility is part of my process from the start:

1. Use semantic HTML
2. Test with keyboard navigation
3. Check color contrast
4. Test with screen readers

## The Impact

Building accessible sites isn't just the right thing to do—it makes sites better for everyone. Better structure, clearer navigation, more robust code.

This focus on accessibility has become central to how I work, and it's something I'm passionate about sharing with others.
